    <p>I've always treated Alfred as a Finder replacement. The speed at which I can find and take action on files is faster than Finder.app or Spotlight will ever be able to do. Because of this, I want to have a quick and easy way to share Dropbox files from within Alfred.</p>


<p>Over the years, I've built version of a workflow that lets me share files with Dropbox. They've always been very specific to me and never reliable or secure enough to share with others. The Dropbox API has come a long ways and now gives me the ability to share this workflow without exposing my app secret.</p>
<p><img alt="File Search" src="https://ryanmo.co/posts/Tech/2017-05-16/file_search.png" /></p>
<p>This is my primary way of searching for files. I have Alfred configured so that I can hit the right arrow to take me to the actions menu.</p>
<p><img alt="File Action" src="https://ryanmo.co/posts/Tech/2017-05-16/file_action.png" /></p>
<p>You'll see that I have two actions set up. One for simply creating a link and another for creating a link that expires in a week. The latter is only possible if you have a Dropbox Pro account.</p>
<p><img alt="Notification" src="https://ryanmo.co/posts/Tech/2017-05-16/notification.png" /></p>
<p>Once you've selected one of the options, a notification will appear telling you that the link was created and the link will then be in your clipboard.</p>
<p>You can download the workflow by clicking the Alfred icon below. Instructions for setting up the workflow can be found by clicking on the [x] in the top-right of the workflow once it's installed. Alfred doesn't do a great job making it easy to find the set-up instructions.</p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Supports multiple accounts if you have a personal and business account</li>
<li>You can create any number of expiring links by creating another action and modifying the Alfred Workflow JSON <code>expires</code> key to a number of days</li>
<li>Do to all of the different permissions that Dropbox offers for their business product, if a link already exists for the file you're trying to share with more restrictive permissions, a link won't be created. It's too difficult to expose what permissions that exist in a notification bubble. </li>
</ul>
