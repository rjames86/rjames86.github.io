With a short script, I can back up my contacts to a folder in my Dropbox account. This will add a vCard file to my Dropbox account with the date the script was run.</p>\n<p><em>Note: You'll need the Dropbox login script for this to work.

            "content_html": "<p>I've been doing a lot more traveling in the last year. Each time I take off or land, I found myself sending nearly the same text message to multiple people. After a while, it began to feel more like a chore than the kind gesture of letting others know I made it safely. For the repetitive messages, I found  way of automating nearly the entire process.</p>\n\n\n<p>Now that Launch Center Pro has the <code>launchpro-messaging://</code> action with x-callback-url support, I can chain SMS messages together. This is something I've been wanting for a long time for this specific use case. When I began writing the action, I found one hiccup in which is I would need to write the message to each individual person unless I wanted to first copy it to my clipboard before running the action. I didn't have luck with the <code>launchpro-clipboard://</code> action while calling the clipboard from the same action even though it is supposed to work in theory<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>I decided to venture out and use Pythonista to generate the url scheme for me and then pass it back into Launch Center Pro's in-app messaging. The nice thing here is that I can cleanly list out all of the contacts to whom I'd like to send the message from with in the script and change the action much more quickly.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">contacts</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span>\n    <span class=\"s1\">&#39;friend1@dropbox.com&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"s1\">&#39;mom@gmail.com&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"s1\">&#39;+1-555-867-5309&#39;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>The script is written in such a way that I can put as many contacts in as I want and the url scheme will still get generated correctly with the url-escaping. </p>\n<p>Now, I have a nice list of message options in Launch Center Pro that will then send the same message to all of my contacts:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Launch Center Pro notifications\" src=\"https://ryanmo.co/2014/01/14/travel-notifications/lcp_notifications.png\" /></p>\n<p>If the \"Just Landed\" option is chosen, a new prompt will be given to type in the place where I landed. Once I'm brought back into the app, I just need to hit send for each message.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-align: center; display: block;\"></p>\n<iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/84171813?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"361\" height=\"642\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p></span></p>\n<p>You can download the Python script <a href=\"https://ryanmo.co/2014/01/14/travel-notifications/Travel_Notices.py\">here</a> and the Launch Center Pro action can be found <a href=\"http://launchcenterpro.com/k0p747\">here</a></p>\n<p>[Update] 2014-02-15  </p>\n<p>I made some updates to the script so that you can send custom notifications for each individual person.
