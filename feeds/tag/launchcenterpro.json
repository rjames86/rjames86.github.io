With a short script, I can back up my contacts to a folder in my Dropbox account. This will add a vCard file to my Dropbox account with the date the script was run.</p>\n<p><em>Note: You'll need the Dropbox login script for this to work.

In most cases, it's just to send to someone quickly. iMessage is easy, but the images aren't compressed nearly enough and can take a while to upload. I've now started uploading the images to Dropbox and sharing the link. The upload speed is reduced since Launch Center Pro will take care of reducing the quality before uploading. The message sends almost instantly because there isn't an attachment. Here are a few of workflows I use with Dropbox:</p>\n<h3 id=\"upload-last-photo-taken-and-get-the-link\">Upload last photo taken and get the link</h3>\n<p><em>This is if I simply need a quick link to share anywhere. The image uploads at 50% quality. I have a folder called Temp/_Destrctable Folder where I keep all my throwaway images.
