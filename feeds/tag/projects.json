In the last few months, I've been spending more and more time trying to fix issues to get it to run reliably. Since this is something that I use often, I figured it was worth just re-writing it myself.</p>\n\n<p>The script is a slightly simpler version of the original, but the core functionality is the same. Each bookmark is saved as a webloc file and apply any OS X tags to the file. This can be paired with an <a href=\"https://ryanmo.co/downloads/pinboard-downloader/Bookmarks.alfredworkflow\">Alfred workflow</a> to easily search by title or tag.</p>\n<p>You can download the download-pinboard project <a href=\"https://github.com/rjames86/download_pinboard/archive/master.zip\">here</a>. Feel free to check out the Github project <a href=\"https://github.com/rjames86/download_pinboard\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"setup\">Setup</h3>\n<p>Create a settings file</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>cp settings.py<span class=\"o\">{</span>.example,<span class=\"o\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>with the following information</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">_PINBOARD_TOKEN</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;YOUR TOKEN HERE&#39;</span>\n<span class=\"n\">_SAVE_PATH</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">HOME</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;/Bookmarks/&#39;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>In settings.py set your Pinboard token and the path where you want your bookmarks to be saved. Your token can be found at <a href=\"https://pinboard.in/settings/password\">https://pinboard.in/settings/password</a>. The path must exist where you save your bookmarks and must end with a trailing /.</p>\n<h3 id=\"running-the-script\">Running the Script</h3>\n<p>To start the script, you can simply do</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"err\">python main.py</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<h4 id=\"optional-arguments\">Optional arguments</h4>\n<p><code>-v, --verbose</code> Shows output as stdout<br />\n<code>-t</code> Filters the bookmarks you want to download by tag. You can pass multiple -t tags, but no more than 3. Multiple tags are AND not OR<br />\n<code>--reset [optional num of days]</code> Resets your last updated time. If you don't specifiy a number, it will reset to 999 days.<br />\n<code>--skip-update</code> Lets you bypass the last downloaded time. Nice for redownloading everything.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"notes-and-todo\">Notes and Todo</h3>\n<p>I have a very small number of bookmarks (~150) and so I don't know if there will be any issues with a really large library. If you have one, and run into problems, please let me know and I'll happily look into it.</p>\n<hr />",
