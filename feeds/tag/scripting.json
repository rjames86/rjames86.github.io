            "content_html": "<p>While reading through my RSS feeds the other night, I came across <a href=\"https://onetapless.com/whats-new-one-tap-less\">this</a> article from One Tap Less about what he did to improve load times on his site. My first thought was,  \"I use a static site, I don't need to worry about this\" and dismissed it. Then I figured, why not just try out my site on Google's <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/\">PageSpeed Insights</a>. Turns out, I had some work to do.</p>\n\n\n<p>When I initially ran the test, this site came back with a score of around 41/100 for both desktop and mobile. I would have been fine leaving it, but that was pretty bad. Google does a great job telling you what things need to be improved, even down to the specific files causing problems.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"file_specific\" src=\"https://ryanmo.co/posts/Tech/2015-09-12/file_specific.png\" /></p>\n<p>My first task was \"eliminating render-blocking JavaScript and CSS.\" I was lazily loading all of my JavaScript in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag, so this was as simple as moving that to the bottom of the page. Google also suggested using the <code>async</code> attribute.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"c\">&lt;!-- Initial setup --&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"cp\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">html</span> <span class=\"na\">lang</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;{{ DEFAULT_LANG }}&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">head</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">script</span> <span class=\"na\">async</span> <span class=\"na\">src</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;{{ SITEURL }}/theme/js/main.js&quot;</span> <span class=\"na\">type</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;text/javascript&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">script</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n  ...\n<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">head</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n\n<span class=\"c\">&lt;!-- New setup --&gt;</span>\n...\n    <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">script</span> <span class=\"na\">async</span> <span class=\"na\">src</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;{{ SITEURL }}/theme/js/main.js&quot;</span> <span class=\"na\">type</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;text/javascript&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">script</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">body</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">html</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Eliminating render-blocking CSS was a little more tricky. Google suggests inlining <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/understanding-critical-css/\">critical CSS</a>. I haven't taken the time to figure out which CSS that would require and how this would change my workflow. For now, I've taken their suggestion and load my CSS at the bottom of the page using a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag.</p>\n<p><em>[Update 2015-09-14]</em>: I figured it out.

You should see <code>Content-Encoding: gzip</code> in the response headers.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>curl -I -H <span class=\"s1\">&#39;Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate&#39;</span> https://ryanmo.co/theme/js/main.js\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 <span class=\"m\">200</span> OK\nDate: Sat, <span class=\"m\">12</span> Sep <span class=\"m\">2015</span> <span class=\"m\">20</span>:38:24 GMT\nServer: Apache/2.4.10 <span class=\"o\">(</span>Unix<span class=\"o\">)</span> PHP/5.5.20 OpenSSL/0.9.8zd\nLast-Modified: Sat, <span class=\"m\">12</span> Sep <span class=\"m\">2015</span> <span class=\"m\">02</span>:47:24 GMT\nETag: <span class=\"s2\">&quot;38169-51f83da1c0700-gzip&quot;</span>\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nVary: Accept-Encoding,User-Agent\nContent-Encoding: gzip\nCache-Control: max-age<span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"m\">2592000</span>\nExpires: Mon, <span class=\"m\">12</span> Oct <span class=\"m\">2015</span> <span class=\"m\">20</span>:38:24 GMT\nContent-Type: application/javascript\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Next is content caching. This is also something to edit in the httpd.conf file for Apache. Google suggests at <em>least</em> 7 days for default caching, and up to a year for content that doesn't change often.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"c1\"># Make sure this is uncommented</span>\nLoadModule expires_module libexec/apache2/mod_expires.so\n\n<span class=\"c1\">## EXPIRES CACHING ##</span>\n&lt;IfModule mod_expires.c&gt;\n    ExpiresActive On\n    ExpiresByType image/jpg <span class=\"s2\">&quot;access plus 1 year&quot;</span>\n    ExpiresByType image/jpeg <span class=\"s2\">&quot;access plus 1 year&quot;</span>\n    ExpiresByType image/gif <span class=\"s2\">&quot;access plus 1 year&quot;</span>\n    ExpiresByType image/png <span class=\"s2\">&quot;access plus 1 year&quot;</span>\n    ExpiresByType application/x-font-ttf <span class=\"s2\">&quot;access plus 1 year&quot;</span>\n    ExpiresByType text/css <span class=\"s2\">&quot;access plus 1 month&quot;</span>\n    ExpiresByType application/javascript <span class=\"s2\">&quot;access plus 1 month&quot;</span>\n    ExpiresByType image/x-icon <span class=\"s2\">&quot;access plus 1 year&quot;</span>\n    ExpiresDefault <span class=\"s2\">&quot;access plus 7 days&quot;</span>\n&lt;/IfModule&gt;\n<span class=\"c1\">## EXPIRES CACHING ##</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>At this point, I was getting into the mid to high 80s for my score. Awesome. At this point, I could probably stop and be satisfied with the results. The remaining suggestions were easy, so I kept going. The first was to minimize all of my CSS and JavaScript. Easy. I just hit that checkbox in CodeKit and moved along. I did take one additional step here and took advantage of CodeKit's ability to combine JavaScript files into a single file by adding a header to my main JavaScript file.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"err\"># @codekit-prepend &quot;../js/jquery-1.10.1.min.js&quot;, &quot;../js/bigfoot.min.js&quot;;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Lastly, Google suggested that I compress my images. They were even nice enough to provide a zipped file of all your CSS, JavaScript and images compressed for you. If I don't have to do the work, then I won't. I downloaded the file and replaced all my images with the ones they gave me. In the future, I'll be using <a href=\"https://imageoptim.com\">ImageOptim</a> to optimize the images on my site.</p>\n<p>My final score check: 91/100 on mobile and 97/100 on desktop! I think I can call that a success. Honestly, when trying to load my site on different devices, I didn't notice a significant increase. That being said, at least I'll be in Google's good graces for being a good web citizen, and I'll avoid any risk of them down-ranking my site for doing things incorrectly. I still want to take advantage of the critical CSS at some point, but I can leave that for another day.</p>",

Some of these things I've already shared in the past and I'll be sure to post more details on any of the other things in the future. </p>\n<h2 id=\"50ways-httpblogmacminicolonetpost4703882550250-ways-to-use-your-server\">[50ways]: http://blog.macminicolo.net/post/47038825502/50-ways-to-use-your-server</h2>\n<div class=\"toc\">\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#50ways-httpblogmacminicolonetpost4703882550250-ways-to-use-your-server\">[50ways]: http://blog.macminicolo.net/post/47038825502/50-ways-to-use-your-server</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#syncing-and-backup\">Syncing and Backup</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#hazel\">Hazel</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#web-server\">Web Server</a><ul>\n<li><a href=\"#blogs\">Blogs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#site-analytics\">Site Analytics</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#url-shortening\">URL Shortening</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#vpn\">VPN</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#tapiriik\">Tapiriik</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#webdav\">WebDAV</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#automation-and-scripts\">Automation and Scripts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#media\">Media</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"syncing-and-backup\">Syncing and Backup</h2>\n<p><strong>Dropbox</strong></p>\n<p>All of my Dropbox files are synced to this computer. My MacBook Air doesn't have enough space to store all my files and so the Mac Mini is the place where I store all my Dropbox files locally so that I can run workflows and have a local backup. </p>\n<p><strong>Off-site Backup</strong></p>\n<p>Since I have so much space, I use it as an offsite backup for my laptop using Arq over sftp. Nothing too fancy or special here, but it's a nice alternative to Time Machine as an offsite backup. </p>\n<h2 id=\"hazel\">Hazel</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php\">Hazel</a> may be my favorite reason for having an always-on Mac. Hazel watches multiple folders in my Dropbox folder and keeps my Dropbox much more organized than I ever would manually. Some of my favorites are</p>\n<p><strong>Organizing my photos</strong></p>\n<p>I've talked about this one a bit in the past. I love that Carousel will automatically upload my photos to Dropbox, but the Camera Uploads folder becomes a wasteland of files if you don't organize them on a regular basis. I move all of my photos into a photos folder organized by year. I've written about this in more detail <a href=\"http://ryanmo.co/2014/01/11/my-photo-workflow/\">here</a>. If you use Carousel and have ever saved photos that someone else shared with you, you'll know that a completely different folder is created in Dropbox called Carousel. In this folder, more folders are created with the email address of the person who shared the photos with you. I want these photos in my normal photos folder and so I run the same set of rules as my Camera Uploads to reorganize these photos. The only exception is that I add a \"carousel\" tag to these photos so that I know they were added from Carousel. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"organize_photos\" src=\"https://ryanmo.co/posts/Tech/2015-02-09/organize_photos.png\" /></p>\n<p>I take a selfie every day (620 days and counting) and am far too lazy to move that photo to its own special photo every day. I've made sure to always use Camera+ to take these photos. Hazel looks at the metadata of the photos in Camera Uploads and if the photo was taken by the front camera and the app used to create the file was Camera+, it's moved to its own special folder and renamed to just YYYY-MM-DD. </p>\n<p><strong>Publishing my blog</strong></p>\n<p>I use a static blog generator, <a href=\"http://blog.getpelican.com\">Pelican</a>,  which means that I can store the entire project, including the Python code in my Dropbox account. While I'm on my Mac, it's easy to run a shell script to publish my blog. On iOS, it's not quite as easy and so I use Hazel to watch my blog folder for a file called 'publish.blog'. If that file exists, the shell script is run and the file is then deleted. Since my girlfriend runs her blog over at <a href=\"http://www.keepitlit.co\">keepitlit.co</a> with the same static blog generator, it's much simpler for her to create a file just like this when she wants to publish her blog. </p>\n<p><strong>IFTTT \u2192 Dropbox \u2192 Flickr \u2192 AppleTV</strong></p>\n<p>I have a rule set up in IFTTT that will append to a text file each time my girlfriend or I post a photo to Instagram. Each time this file runs, I have a script that uploads the photo to a private Flickr album. My AppleTV is then set to that album so that we have an updated list of photos as a screen saver. I realize I could do this directly in IFTTT, but I don't like that you can't make the album private. </p>\n<p>Download the script <a href=\"https://ryanmo.co/posts/Tech/2015-02-09/ifttt_to_flickr.py\">here</a></p>\n<p><strong>Time sensitive Dropbox shared links</strong></p>\n<p>If you have a Dropbox Pro account,  this is now a feature built right in.  I have two folders named \"One day\" and \"One week\". Files that I want to share temporarily are copied to that folder. After the set amount of time, the files will be deleted and I'm sent a push notification. For the one week folder, I also get a notification the day before to remind me that it'll get deleted.</p>\n<p>You can download the 1 Day rule <a href=\"https://ryanmo.co/posts/Tech/2015-02-09/1 day.hazelrules\">here</a>. Be sure to add your own Pushover key and secret, or remove it if you don't need notifications.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"1%20day\" src=\"https://ryanmo.co/posts/Tech/2015-02-09/1 day.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Scanned files</strong></p>\n<p>This folder is for files added from my Fujitsu ScanSnap or Scanbot for iOS. If the file hasn't been OCR'd already, a script will run to launch PDFPenPro and OCR the file. I then have a series of rules set up to move the files based on their names.</p>\n<p>Work Receipts is my favorite. When I scan a receipt in Scanbot, I have a snippet \"wwr\" that expands to \"Work receipt\". Hazel watches for any new PDFs with that string in the filename. Files are then moved to my expenses folder, organized by date. It then creates a new task in Due.app with a due date of one week in the future so that I'll remember to do my expenses for the file. I no longer have to keep all my receipts and I'll never forget to actually do the expenses<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Business cards obviously moves any business cards to a special folder. Hazel watches for a string match in the filename to know to file these as well. Finally, personal receipts moves the files to my own receipts folder for archiving.</p>\n<h2 id=\"web-server\">Web Server</h2>\n<p>I use this Mac Mini as a web server since it has more than enough bandwidth and speed. I had never set up an server before, and so this was a fun learning experience to do it all myself. I run a very basic Apache, MySQL, PHP stack for my web server. </p>\n<h3 id=\"blogs\">Blogs</h3>\n<p>I host this blog from my Mac Mini as well as a couple of others, most notably my girlfriend's. </p>\n<h3 id=\"site-analytics\">Site Analytics</h3>\n<p>I don't want to use Google Analytics. They know enough about me already and so I use an open source version called Piwik. I've been fairly happy with it so far. </p>\n<h3 id=\"url-shortening\">URL Shortening</h3>\n<p>I don't like long urls and will shorten them whenever I can. When I publish my blog, I always shorten the URL. I like having full control over that and so I'm using <a href=\"http://yourls.org\">yourls</a> to shorten and track URLs. </p>\n<h3 id=\"vpn\">VPN</h3>\n<p>I was running OS X Server and used the Mac Mini as a VPN server. Since upgrading to Yosemite, I haven't gotten around to upgrading server, but it's on the todo list. Check out Macminicolo's blog for some great instructions on setting up a VPN <a href=\"http://blog.macminicolo.net/post/102283942903/setup-a-vpn-with-yosemite-server-10-10\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tapiriik\">Tapiriik</h3>\n<p>When I'm out cycling, I use a Garmin GPS. Most of my friends use RunKeeper, and I prefer Strava over all of the services. <a href=\"https://tapiriik.com\">Tapiriik</a> is a great service that lets you keep your fitness services all in sync, including syncing TCX files to your Dropbox account. It's open source, so you can run a local version on your own computer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"webdav\">WebDAV</h3>\n<p>When I was using Omnifocus, I didn't want to sync my database through their servers. I could be wrong, but I don't believe it's encrypted on their servers. I feel much better knowing that it's on my machine and I have completely control of it. I have set up my own WebDAV server so that I can sync my database. It's been extremely fast and reliable. </p>\n<h2 id=\"automation-and-scripts\">Automation and Scripts</h2>\n<p>I have crons running on an hourly, daily and weekly bases. I don't want to bore you with all of them, but here are a few of the better ones. </p>\n<p><strong>getmail</strong></p>\n<p>I use getmail  for archiving my Gmail daily (they've been known to lose data once in a while). I've never needed to use it, but if I ever decide to change providers or Gmail just hits the delete key someday, I'll have a complete backup of my email. A great introduction to getmail can be found <a href=\"http://www.makethenmakeinstall.com/2013/02/script-gmail-backup-with-getmail-on-linux/\">here</a></p>\n<p><strong>Slogger</strong></p>\n<p>I love Slogger and Day One. I've customized a lot of the current plugins and even wrote my own for Instagram. You can read more about it <a href=\"http://ryanmo.co/2014/09/04/instagram-slogger/\">here</a></p>\n<p><strong>Download Pinboard</strong></p>\n<p>My updated version of Brett Terpstra's pinboard \u2192 webloc file script to have tagged webloc files locally. You can read more about this project <a href=\"{static}../2014-12-23/2014-12-23_Download-Pinboard-as-Webloc-Files.md\">here</a>. </p>\n<p><strong>Face detection \u2192 Finder tags</strong></p>\n<p>I don't want to use iPhoto, Aperture or Picasa as a photo management application. Instead, I use Picasa to harvest the facial recognition data, and then have a script that applies Finder tags of the person's name to the photo. I haven't shared this one, because it's not done yet, but it's functional. It's a lot of fun to be able to get all the photos of a person with a simple Spotlight search. Hopefully I can share this in the near future.</p>\n<p><strong>Dropbox Deletions</strong></p>\n<p>I like to keep tabs on my shared folders and any scripts that might be running in my Dropbox account. I parse my Dropbox RSS feeds for deletions of more than 50 files and send myself a push notification with Pushover.</p>\n<p>You can download the script <a href=\"https://ryanmo.co/posts/Tech/2015-02-09/dropbox_events.py\">here</a></p>\n<p><strong>Dropbox inbox</strong></p>\n<p>Throughout the week, I'll add files to an \"Inbox\" in my Dropbox folder. On the weekends, I send myself a push notification if there have been any files added so that I can deal with them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"media\">Media</h2>\n<p>I don't have a lot of media. I've never been attached to the idea of owning my music or video and stream whatever I can. For any content that I've ripped over the years, I have <a href=\"https://plex.tv\">Plex</a> running on my Mac Mini. Again, since the connection is so fast, there's little to no lag when streaming something from home or on my phone. </p>\n<div class=\"footnote\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>I've recently switched from Omnifocus to Due2. It took me a bit to figure out how to programmatically create task items, especially if I want emojis in it.
