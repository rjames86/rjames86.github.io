            "content_html": "<p>Throughout the day I think of things that I need to do after work or this coming weekend. The best way for me to not forget these is to quickly get them into Omnifocus. I've been using Drafts on my iPhone and Alfred on my Mac to quickly create tasks with the appropriate deferral and due dates. This has worked really well except for when I want to add more than one task at a time. </p>\n<p>Not too long ago, Omnifocus added the ability to import tasks in Taskpaper format. The import initially seemed very basic and only allowed you to dump them into Omnifocus' Inbox for processing. Digging into the documentation shows that you can be more specific about what project you want those tasks to go into as well as context, defer and due dates.</p>\n<p>Up until now, if I wanted to create multiple tasks for tonight, I would have to add each one individually in Drafts and use my \"Due Tonight\" action, return to Drafts and repeat. Using the Taskpaper syntax import, I can now add multiple lines as tasks in Drafts and import. Each line would look something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>- Take out the garbage @flagged(true) @context(Admin &amp; Routines) @defer(6pm) @due(8pm)\n- Finish blog post @flagged(true) @context(Admin &amp; Routines) @defer(6pm) @due(8pm)\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Since Drafts supports JavaScript, I can create a single script to support my tonight, weekend or today tasks.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nx\">targetTask</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;Todo&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"nx\">defaultTaskString</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;@flagged(true) @context(Admin &amp;

            "content_html": "<p>I've chosen to not use iCloud Photo Library for a few reasons. I have a decent system set up for storing my photos in Dropbox, but I've always wanted to have my photos local on my iPhone. Now that iOS 10 has some cool features like memories and image search, I've been looking for a way to have my photos on my iPhone and also in Dropbox.</p>\n\n\n<p>The easy solution is to simply point iTunes to your photo library in Dropbox and sync your photos over. This has a few downsides:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If your photo library is large, you can't sync everything over</li>\n<li>iTunes doesn't let you sync multiple folders, so its all or nothing</li>\n<li>iTunes creates a thumbnail cache in the folder of photos, which means you have a large folder constantly syncing to Dropbox, which isn't ideal</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I already use Hazel to sort and organize my photos, so I figured adding another workflow would be fairly easy. On the computer where I sync my iPhone to iTunes, I set up a workflow that looks like this</p>\n<p><img alt=\"1\" src=\"https://ryanmo.co/posts/Tech/2017-01-23/1.png\" /></p>\n<p>Since my photo folder structure looks like [year]/[month]/[event], I need to look at each of the photos and then continue the workflow if it matches a matches a shell command</p>\n<p><img alt=\"2\" src=\"https://ryanmo.co/posts/Tech/2017-01-23/2.png\" /></p>\n<p>As long as what Hazel processes is a folder, and matches this regular expression, we can continue on to process the photos. This regular expression looks for a folder path that contains the the numbers 2015 through 2019<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup>. You can change the 5 to be whatever range you need, but I didn't need to go back to photos older than that.</p>\n<p>The next step is creating a hard link to the photo to a new folder I keep in <code>~/Pictures</code> called \"Photos for iPhone.\"</p>\n<p><img alt=\"3\" src=\"https://ryanmo.co/posts/Tech/2017-01-23/3.png\" /></p>\n<p>A hard link is nice here since it simply references the original file and doesn't take up space on your hard drive.</p>\n<p>Now I can point iTunes to my newly created folder. Each time a new photo gets added to my Dropbox photos folder, a new hard link is created and then synced to my iPhone the next time I plug it in.</p>\n<div class=\"footnote\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>This will stop working after 2019, but by that point, I'd hope that syncing and viewing photos will be in a better place.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:1\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

            "content_html": "<p>It's been a few months since my last post. I've spent a lot of time working on my blog, but all things behind the scenes that most people wouldn't even notice. </p>\n<p>Setting keyboard shortcuts on Mac is actually fairly easy, but it requires a lot of clicking around. Fortunately there's a way to do this from the terminal that's faster and easier.</p>\n\n\n<p>The <code>defaults</code> command in MacOS is nothing short of a mystery. It does some powerful things, but the documentation is sparse and half of the time I don't know what I'm doing. That being said, I've had a script written for a long time called <code>new_computer.sh</code> where I set all of my favorite global and application-specific shortcuts when getting a new computer.</p>\n<p>Let's take an example of a shortcut everyone should have: Print As PDF from within a print dialog. I've always set it to \u2318 \u21e7 P. To do this within System Preferences, the steps are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the Keyboard preference Pane</li>\n<li>Click the Shortcuts tab</li>\n<li>Click App Shortcuts</li>\n<li>Click the + symbol</li>\n<li>Fill out the prompts<ul>\n<li>Leave All Applications Selected</li>\n<li>Menu Title is \"Save as PDF\u2026\" (it's an elipsis, not three periods. Type <code>option ;</code> to get the symbol)</li>\n<li>Choose your shortcut</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It's almost too many steps for one shortcut, let alone multiple. Let's try this in Terminal:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>defaults write -globalDomain NSUserKeyEquivalents  -dict-add <span class=\"s2\">&quot;Save as PDF\\\\U2026&quot;</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;@\\$p&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Easy, right? Sort of. The syntax for writing global shortcuts is fairly straight forward. If you're not creating a shortcut for a specific application, you can use the command above and simply change the title and shortcut. Here are how to represent all of the modifier keys:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@ is command</li>\n<li>^ is control</li>\n<li>~ is option</li>\n<li>$ is shift</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So command-shift p becomes <code>\"@\\$p\"</code>.</p>\n<p>The reason this came up was that Omnifocus recently added tabs. This is great except that there's no shortcut for cycling through the tabs. This makes the feature almost pointless for me. So to add shortcuts, I ended up using the command above, but I need to target Omnifocus only.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>defaults write com.omnigroup.OmniFocus2 NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add <span class=\"s2\">&quot;Show Next Tab&quot;</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;^\\\\U005D&quot;</span>\ndefaults write com.omnigroup.OmniFocus2 NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add <span class=\"s2\">&quot;Show Previous Tab&quot;</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;^\\\\U005B&quot;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Here I'm setting show next/previous tab to control [ and control ]. Once you've set your keyboard shortcuts, you'll need to quit and re-launch the application in order for the new preferences to be read.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>I'll be soon embarking on a long bike tour and was searching for a way to keep a journal of my trip but also post updates to a website. Day One was an obvious journaling choice, but with version 2, publishing isn't yet available. With a little poking around, it turned out to be fairly easy to export Day One entries and publish to Pelican (my static blog generator of choice).</p>\n\n\n<p>I've not been a heavy user of Day One, and with the new version, I've stopped entirely until they provide end-to-end encryption with their proprietary sync service. Journaling my bike trip isn't anything I'm worried about being out in the open, and so I'll use it to keep a log of my days on the trip. At the same time, I want to keep my friends and family up-to-date on my trip. Since I use Pelican for this site, it seemed like a reasonable choice to use it for this trip and use Github Pages as an easy, free place to host it.</p>\n<p>The first step was getting the Pelican site set up. I used the basic quickstart and put in a custom theme that I found online. The only modifications I made was using the <a href=\"https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/photos\">photos plugin</a> to make it easier to add galleries if I want in the future. Publishing to Github Pages is trivial. You can follow the steps <a href=\"http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/tips.html#publishing-to-github\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Now the fun part. Day One lets you export a journal entry as Markdown. When exported, it's compressed into a zip file which includes a folder of photos if you've included any in the journal entry. For each post, I use the export action and then upload to a folder I've created in Dropbox. I have Hazel watching this folder which will do the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Unarchive any file that appears</li>\n<li>Move the unarchived contents into a new folder I unoriginally name \"decompressed\"</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"unarchive\" src=\"https://ryanmo.co/posts/Tech/2016-08-19/unarchive.png\" /></p>\n<p>I then have a separate rule watching \"decompressed\" which will</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Move any image file type into my blog's images folder</li>\n<li>Move any text file into the content folder</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"move_text\" src=\"https://ryanmo.co/posts/Tech/2016-08-19/move_text.png\" /></p>\n<p>Step 2 here requires a little bit of extra work. Day One has some weird formatting issues and I also need to update the image urls in the entry to match what Pelican expects. The script isn't my finest, but it takes care of everything</p>\n<table class=\"codehilitetable\"><tr><td class=\"linenos\"><div class=\"linenodiv\"><pre> 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n

That's still janky and I'd rather have this done without having to click a bunch of times.</p>\n<p>I first wrote the script using Applescript. I ran into some annoying issues when trying to ignore certain notification windows, such as System Updates.

            "content_html": "<p>I've been a long time TextExpander user. I use it every day for simple things like pasting my contact info or shortening urls using bit.ly. There are plenty of articles out there arguing for and against TextExpander's new subscription model. I support their decision but I can't justify $50 a year's worth of value and so I'm moving all of my snippets to Keyboard Maestro.</p>\n\n\n<p>I had been thinking this weekend whether it would be worth the time to try to migrate all my snippets to Keyboard Maestro. Browsing my Twitter feed, it looked as though <a href=\"http://leancrew.com/all-this/2016/04/importing-textexpander-snippets-to-keyboard-maestro/\">Dr. Drang</a> had beat me to it. Unfortunately he didn't do the work I was hoping I wouldn't have to do, and so I sat down to see how hard it would be to convert snippets to macros. Turns out...not that hard.</p>\n<p>Here are the requirements for running this script:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Python 2.7 (I didn't test Python 3.x). If you're running an older/newer version of Python, you should be able to replace <code>python</code> with <code>/usr/bin/python2.7</code> when running the script.</li>\n<li>TextExpander 5.x. If you are running version 4, your settings will be named Settings.textexpander instead of Settings.textexpandersettings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've made some decisions as to how I want the snippets to work. Notably</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pasting instead of typing. Typing is too slow.</li>\n<li>Delete the last clipboard item, since it was the text that was just pasted. </li>\n<li>Groups remain the same. If you used groups in TextExpander, they show up as \"Snippets - <group name>\" in Keyboard Maestro. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are a few things that I haven't yet solved. Some I might in the future, others maybe not:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I didn't test Applescript since I didn't have any. Please let me know if that one breaks.</li>\n<li>Placeholders and variables from TextExpander won't work. This means if you had a \"today's date\" snippet, you'll need to rewrite that one<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup>.</li>\n<li>Custom delimiters. I haven't really figured out if there's a way to do this. I've tried changing Keyboard Maestro to only fire on delimiters, but it doesn't seem to work. If anyone figured this out, please let me know.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before running, be sure to update the variable <code>TEXTEXPANDER_PATH</code> to wherever your TextExpander settings file lives. To run, it's as simple as navigating to the location where the script lives in Terminal.app and entering</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"err\">python TE.py</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>You'll now have a folder on your Desktop named 'TextExpander_to_KeyboardMaestro' with all of your groups.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Update 2016-04-12</em></p>\n<p>Big thanks to NW in the comments for helping me debug a few things.</p>\n<p>I've removed the import of <code>enum</code>. I had forgotten that wasn't a standard library in Python 2.7. I also added a list of requirements above for running the script.</p>\n<p><em>Update 2016-04-14</em></p>\n<p>Also thanks to Dr Drang for posting about the script! I've made some updates and also put up a repo for those who would like to make edits and pull requests.</p>\n<p>Updates are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Optional prefix if you want to change that up when moving to Keyboard Maestro</li>\n<li>Insert text by typing OR pasting</li>\n<li>Added some instruction on how to edit the variables to have the script do what you want</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The repo is now hosted at

            "content_html": "<p>Happy 2016! It's been a while since I've gotten something up here.</p>\n\n<p>Last week at work I was working on a fairly large refactor of our front-end. Large pieces of code were being moved around and others re-written to be cleaner and more understandable. Throughout this process, I was leaving myself todo's so that I'd remember to fix something later.  Problem is, I would rarely ever go back to them. That was until someone on my team shared some bash functions they had written to make following up on those todo's much easier</p>\n\n\n<p>It's fairly common practice to leave yourself todo's as comments in code such as</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"err\"># TODO(ryan) fix this later.</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>That way if someone comes across it in the future, they'll know that whatever is below may not be perfect and that I plan on fixing it at some point. Finding all your todo's later is a different story. That's where some fancy bash functions come in handy.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">function</span> ga_code_search<span class=\"o\">()</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"c1\"># alias todo=&#39;ga_code_search &quot;TODO\\(`whoami`\\)&quot;&#39;</span>\n    <span class=\"nv\">SCREEN_WIDTH</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"sb\">`</span>stty size <span class=\"p\">|</span> awk <span class=\"s1\">&#39;{print $2}&#39;</span><span class=\"sb\">`</span>\n    <span class=\"nv\">SCREEN_WIDTH</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"k\">$((</span>SCREEN_WIDTH-4<span class=\"k\">))</span>\n    <span class=\"c1\"># Given a spooky name so you can alias to whatever you want. </span>\n    <span class=\"c1\"># (cs for codesearch)</span>\n    <span class=\"c1\"># AG is WAY faster but requires a binary </span>\n    <span class=\"c1\"># (try brew install the_silver_searcher)</span>\n    <span class=\"nv\">AG_SEARCH</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;ag &quot;$1&quot; | sort -k1 | cat -n | cut -c 1-$SCREEN_WIDTH&#39;</span>\n\n    <span class=\"c1\"># egrep is installed everywhere and is the default.</span>\n    <span class=\"nv\">GREP_SEARCH</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;egrep -nR &quot;$1&quot; * | sort -k1 | cat -n | cut -c 1-$SCREEN_WIDTH&#39;</span>\n\n    <span class=\"nv\">SEARCH</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nv\">$AG_SEARCH</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span> <span class=\"nv\">$#</span> -eq <span class=\"m\">0</span> <span class=\"o\">]</span><span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"k\">then</span>\n\n        <span class=\"nb\">echo</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;Usage: ga_code_search &lt;search&gt; &lt;index_to_edit&gt;&quot;</span>\n        <span class=\"nb\">echo</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;&quot;</span>\n        <span class=\"nb\">echo</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;Examples:&quot;</span>\n        <span class=\"nb\">echo</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;    ga_code_search TODO&quot;</span>\n        <span class=\"nb\">echo</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;    ga_code_search TODO 1&quot;</span>\n        <span class=\"nb\">echo</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;    ga_code_search \\&quot;TODO\\\\(graham\\\\)\\&quot;&quot;</span>\n        <span class=\"nb\">echo</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;    ga_code_search \\&quot;TODO\\\\(graham\\\\)\\&quot; 4&quot;</span>\n        <span class=\"nb\">echo</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;&quot;</span>        \n        <span class=\"k\">return</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">fi</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span> <span class=\"nv\">$#</span> -eq <span class=\"m\">1</span> <span class=\"o\">]</span><span class=\"p\">;</span> <span class=\"k\">then</span>\n        <span class=\"c1\"># There are no command line argumnets.</span>\n        <span class=\"nb\">eval</span> <span class=\"nv\">$SEARCH</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">else</span>\n        <span class=\"c1\"># arg one should be a line from the output of above.</span>\n        <span class=\"nv\">LINE</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$SEARCH</span><span class=\"s2\"> | sed &#39;</span><span class=\"nv\">$2</span><span class=\"s2\">q;d&#39; | awk -F&#39;:&#39; &#39;{print +\\$2 \\&quot; \\&quot; \\$1}&#39; | awk -F&#39; &#39; &#39;{print \\$1 \\&quot; \\&quot; \\$3}&#39;&quot;</span>\n        <span class=\"c1\"># Modify with your editor here.</span>\n        emacs <span class=\"se\">\\+</span><span class=\"sb\">`</span><span class=\"nb\">eval</span> <span class=\"nv\">$LINE</span><span class=\"sb\">`</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">fi</span>    \n<span class=\"o\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>If you read through the comments, <code>the_silver_searcher</code> is far faster than <code>grep</code> for searching contents of files. If you don't have it already, I'd highly suggest installing it with <code>brew install the_silver_searcher</code>. If you don't want to, be sure to change <code>SEARCH=$AG_SEARCH</code> to <code>SEARCH=$GREP_SEARCH</code>.</p>\n<p>The function itself isn't that interesting. It's when you assign aliases to use this function that things become interesting. Here are the three that were given to me:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"c1\"># Find todo items that are assigned to me. TODO(ryan)</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># You can change `whoami` to whatever you want.</span>\n<span class=\"nb\">alias</span> <span class=\"nv\">todo</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;ga_code_search &quot;TODO\\(`whoami`\\)&quot;&#39;</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\"># Find merge conflicts that need to be resolved.</span>\n<span class=\"nb\">alias</span> <span class=\"nv\">conflicts</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;ga_code_search &quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;&#39;</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\"># Find anything below your CWD.</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># You can now type `cs some_piece_of_code`</span>\n<span class=\"nb\">alias</span> <span class=\"nv\">cs</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;ga_code_search&#39;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>My favorite by far is the first alias <code>todo</code>. Here is some example output when running this command:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>&gt; my_project <span class=\"o\">(</span>master<span class=\"o\">)</span>: todo\n <span class=\"m\">1</span>  app/models/strava.py:102: <span class=\"c1\"># TODO(ryan) probably should memoize this at some point so its faster.</span>\n <span class=\"m\">2</span>  app/models/strava.py:148: <span class=\"c1\"># TODO(ryan) make this line prettier</span>\n <span class=\"m\">3</span>  app/templates/strava/index.html:50: &lt;!-- TODO<span class=\"o\">(</span>ryan<span class=\"o\">)</span> move this into its own template file at some point --&gt;\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Notice how there are numbers next to each result? That's because you can also open the file right to that todo item by typing <code>todo 1</code>! As the function is written, it will open in emacs. If that's your editor of choice, you'll be set. I'm personally a fan of Sublime Text. There's a way to also open a file in Sublime Text to a specific line number. Simply change the text in red with that in green:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"gd\">- LINE=&quot;$SEARCH | sed &#39;$2q;d&#39; | awk -F&#39;:&#39; &#39;{print +\\$2 \\&quot; \\&quot; \\$1}&#39; | awk -F&#39; &#39; &#39;{print \\$1 \\&quot; \\&quot; \\$3}&#39;&quot;</span>\n<span class=\"gi\">+ LINE=&quot;$SEARCH | sed &#39;$2q;d&#39; | awk -F&#39;:&#39; &#39;{print +\\$2 \\&quot; \\&quot; \\$1}&#39; | awk -F&#39; &#39; &#39;{print \\$3 \\&quot;:\\&quot; \\$1}&#39;&quot;</span>\n\n<span class=\"gd\">- emacs \\+`eval $LINE`</span>\n<span class=\"gi\">+ subl `eval $LINE`</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>I've only used the functions for a few days now, but it's greatly improved my workflow for getting old todo's done in code.

            "summary": "\n<p>Last week at work I was working on a fairly large refactor of our front-end. Large pieces of code were being moved around and others re-written to be cleaner and more understandable. Throughout this process, I was leaving myself todo's so that I'd remember to fix something later.  Problem is, I would rarely ever go back to them. That was until someone on my team shared some bash functions they had written to make following up on those todo's much easier</p>\n",

The remaining few that are left in Alfred are ones that I heavily depend on, one of which is accessing my Server Favorites in OS X. </p>\n<p>Up until OS X 10.11 El Capitan, Server Favorites were stored in a plist file called <code>com.apple.sidebarlists.plist</code>. I finally got around to upgrading my computers at home only to realize that my \"server\" workflow stopped working.

After a bunch of searching, and the help of Houdaspot, I found them in <code>~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.sharedfilelist/com.apple.LSSharedFileList.FavoriteServers.sfl</code>.

sharedAddressBook];</code>, this gets converted to dot notation <code>$.ABAddressBook.sharedAddressBook</code>. The Obj-C bridge is always called with either <code>ObjC.</code> or <code>$.</code> followed by the method.</p>\n<p>You can find a nice list of different properties and values for the address book <a href=\"http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2002/08/27/cocoa.html?page=2\">here</a>. For labels, the most common will be <code>$.kABHomeLabel</code> and <code>$.kABWorkLabel</code> for home and work respectively. If you've created a custom label (let's call it XXX), you can reference it by calling <code>$.kABXXXLabel</code>.</p>\n<p>As with any other JavaScript snippet in TextExpander, you can call any of these functions to expand the contact information that you'd like.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nx\">getEmailByLabel</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;home&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>  <span class=\"c1\">// returns your home phone number</span>\n\n<span class=\"nx\">getAddressByLabel</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;work&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>  <span class=\"c1\">// returns your work address</span>\n\n<span class=\"nx\">getAddressByLabel</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;iPhone&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>  <span class=\"c1\">// returns your phone number labeled iPhone</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>For those of you who don't like copy/pasting the same code over and over, there's a nice little hack that you can do in TextExpander.</p>\n<p>First, create a new Plain Text snippet with the code from the top of the post. I called the snippet \"getInfoFromContacts\". Once that's done, you can create new snippets that take advantage of this code by creating new JavaScript snippets with the following:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"o\">%</span><span class=\"nx\">snippet</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"nx\">getInfoFromContacts</span><span class=\"o\">%</span>\n<span class=\"nx\">getEmailByLabel</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;home&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>This way, if you update something from the main part of the code, you don't have to update all of your TextExpanders.</p>",

My site's layout doesn't contain <em>that</em> much styling, and so I simply added all of my CSS as an inline <code>style</code> tag. The tricky part, was getting Jinja to play nicely.</p>\n<p>The first step was to generate a separate css file that only contained what was needed when you first load and see the page. I use Less as my pre-processor, and created a very small Less file that looked like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">@</span><span class=\"k\">import</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"nt\">inline</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;../tipuesearch/tipuesearch.css&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"p\">@</span><span class=\"k\">import</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;default_mobile.less&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">@</span><span class=\"k\">import</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;largescreens.less&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Once compiled and minimized<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup>, I needed to add it to my <code>base.html</code> template.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"x\">&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"cp\">{%</span> <span class=\"k\">include</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;critical.css&#39;</span> <span class=\"cp\">%}</span><span class=\"x\"></span>\n<span class=\"x\">&lt;/style&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Here is where the problem when generating my site.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>WARNING: Caught exception <span class=\"s2\">&quot;TemplateSyntaxError: Missing end of comment tag&quot;</span>.

Nothing too fancy or special here, but it's a nice alternative to Time Machine as an offsite backup. </p>\n<h2 id=\"hazel\">Hazel</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php\">Hazel</a> may be my favorite reason for having an always-on Mac. Hazel watches multiple folders in my Dropbox folder and keeps my Dropbox much more organized than I ever would manually. Some of my favorites are</p>\n<p><strong>Organizing my photos</strong></p>\n<p>I've talked about this one a bit in the past. I love that Carousel will automatically upload my photos to Dropbox, but the Camera Uploads folder becomes a wasteland of files if you don't organize them on a regular basis. I move all of my photos into a photos folder organized by year. I've written about this in more detail <a href=\"http://ryanmo.co/2014/01/11/my-photo-workflow/\">here</a>. If you use Carousel and have ever saved photos that someone else shared with you, you'll know that a completely different folder is created in Dropbox called Carousel. In this folder, more folders are created with the email address of the person who shared the photos with you. I want these photos in my normal photos folder and so I run the same set of rules as my Camera Uploads to reorganize these photos. The only exception is that I add a \"carousel\" tag to these photos so that I know they were added from Carousel. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"organize_photos\" src=\"https://ryanmo.co/posts/Tech/2015-02-09/organize_photos.png\" /></p>\n<p>I take a selfie every day (620 days and counting) and am far too lazy to move that photo to its own special photo every day. I've made sure to always use Camera+ to take these photos. Hazel looks at the metadata of the photos in Camera Uploads and if the photo was taken by the front camera and the app used to create the file was Camera+, it's moved to its own special folder and renamed to just YYYY-MM-DD. </p>\n<p><strong>Publishing my blog</strong></p>\n<p>I use a static blog generator, <a href=\"http://blog.getpelican.com\">Pelican</a>,  which means that I can store the entire project, including the Python code in my Dropbox account. While I'm on my Mac, it's easy to run a shell script to publish my blog. On iOS, it's not quite as easy and so I use Hazel to watch my blog folder for a file called 'publish.blog'. If that file exists, the shell script is run and the file is then deleted. Since my girlfriend runs her blog over at <a href=\"http://www.keepitlit.co\">keepitlit.co</a> with the same static blog generator, it's much simpler for her to create a file just like this when she wants to publish her blog. </p>\n<p><strong>IFTTT \u2192 Dropbox \u2192 Flickr \u2192 AppleTV</strong></p>\n<p>I have a rule set up in IFTTT that will append to a text file each time my girlfriend or I post a photo to Instagram. Each time this file runs, I have a script that uploads the photo to a private Flickr album. My AppleTV is then set to that album so that we have an updated list of photos as a screen saver. I realize I could do this directly in IFTTT, but I don't like that you can't make the album private. </p>\n<p>Download the script <a href=\"https://ryanmo.co/posts/Tech/2015-02-09/ifttt_to_flickr.py\">here</a></p>\n<p><strong>Time sensitive Dropbox shared links</strong></p>\n<p>If you have a Dropbox Pro account,  this is now a feature built right in.  I have two folders named \"One day\" and \"One week\". Files that I want to share temporarily are copied to that folder. After the set amount of time, the files will be deleted and I'm sent a push notification. For the one week folder, I also get a notification the day before to remind me that it'll get deleted.</p>\n<p>You can download the 1 Day rule <a href=\"https://ryanmo.co/posts/Tech/2015-02-09/1 day.hazelrules\">here</a>. Be sure to add your own Pushover key and secret, or remove it if you don't need notifications.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"1%20day\" src=\"https://ryanmo.co/posts/Tech/2015-02-09/1 day.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Scanned files</strong></p>\n<p>This folder is for files added from my Fujitsu ScanSnap or Scanbot for iOS. If the file hasn't been OCR'd already, a script will run to launch PDFPenPro and OCR the file. I then have a series of rules set up to move the files based on their names.</p>\n<p>Work Receipts is my favorite. When I scan a receipt in Scanbot, I have a snippet \"wwr\" that expands to \"Work receipt\". Hazel watches for any new PDFs with that string in the filename. Files are then moved to my expenses folder, organized by date. It then creates a new task in Due.app with a due date of one week in the future so that I'll remember to do my expenses for the file. I no longer have to keep all my receipts and I'll never forget to actually do the expenses<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Business cards obviously moves any business cards to a special folder. Hazel watches for a string match in the filename to know to file these as well. Finally, personal receipts moves the files to my own receipts folder for archiving.</p>\n<h2 id=\"web-server\">Web Server</h2>\n<p>I use this Mac Mini as a web server since it has more than enough bandwidth and speed. I had never set up an server before, and so this was a fun learning experience to do it all myself. I run a very basic Apache, MySQL, PHP stack for my web server. </p>\n<h3 id=\"blogs\">Blogs</h3>\n<p>I host this blog from my Mac Mini as well as a couple of others, most notably my girlfriend's. </p>\n<h3 id=\"site-analytics\">Site Analytics</h3>\n<p>I don't want to use Google Analytics. They know enough about me already and so I use an open source version called Piwik. I've been fairly happy with it so far. </p>\n<h3 id=\"url-shortening\">URL Shortening</h3>\n<p>I don't like long urls and will shorten them whenever I can. When I publish my blog, I always shorten the URL. I like having full control over that and so I'm using <a href=\"http://yourls.org\">yourls</a> to shorten and track URLs. </p>\n<h3 id=\"vpn\">VPN</h3>\n<p>I was running OS X Server and used the Mac Mini as a VPN server. Since upgrading to Yosemite, I haven't gotten around to upgrading server, but it's on the todo list. Check out Macminicolo's blog for some great instructions on setting up a VPN <a href=\"http://blog.macminicolo.net/post/102283942903/setup-a-vpn-with-yosemite-server-10-10\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tapiriik\">Tapiriik</h3>\n<p>When I'm out cycling, I use a Garmin GPS. Most of my friends use RunKeeper, and I prefer Strava over all of the services. <a href=\"https://tapiriik.com\">Tapiriik</a> is a great service that lets you keep your fitness services all in sync, including syncing TCX files to your Dropbox account. It's open source, so you can run a local version on your own computer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"webdav\">WebDAV</h3>\n<p>When I was using Omnifocus, I didn't want to sync my database through their servers. I could be wrong, but I don't believe it's encrypted on their servers. I feel much better knowing that it's on my machine and I have completely control of it. I have set up my own WebDAV server so that I can sync my database. It's been extremely fast and reliable. </p>\n<h2 id=\"automation-and-scripts\">Automation and Scripts</h2>\n<p>I have crons running on an hourly, daily and weekly bases. I don't want to bore you with all of them, but here are a few of the better ones. </p>\n<p><strong>getmail</strong></p>\n<p>I use getmail  for archiving my Gmail daily (they've been known to lose data once in a while). I've never needed to use it, but if I ever decide to change providers or Gmail just hits the delete key someday, I'll have a complete backup of my email. A great introduction to getmail can be found <a href=\"http://www.makethenmakeinstall.com/2013/02/script-gmail-backup-with-getmail-on-linux/\">here</a></p>\n<p><strong>Slogger</strong></p>\n<p>I love Slogger and Day One. I've customized a lot of the current plugins and even wrote my own for Instagram. You can read more about it <a href=\"http://ryanmo.co/2014/09/04/instagram-slogger/\">here</a></p>\n<p><strong>Download Pinboard</strong></p>\n<p>My updated version of Brett Terpstra's pinboard \u2192 webloc file script to have tagged webloc files locally. You can read more about this project <a href=\"{static}../2014-12-23/2014-12-23_Download-Pinboard-as-Webloc-Files.md\">here</a>. </p>\n<p><strong>Face detection \u2192 Finder tags</strong></p>\n<p>I don't want to use iPhoto, Aperture or Picasa as a photo management application. Instead, I use Picasa to harvest the facial recognition data, and then have a script that applies Finder tags of the person's name to the photo. I haven't shared this one, because it's not done yet, but it's functional. It's a lot of fun to be able to get all the photos of a person with a simple Spotlight search. Hopefully I can share this in the near future.</p>\n<p><strong>Dropbox Deletions</strong></p>\n<p>I like to keep tabs on my shared folders and any scripts that might be running in my Dropbox account. I parse my Dropbox RSS feeds for deletions of more than 50 files and send myself a push notification with Pushover.</p>\n<p>You can download the script <a href=\"https://ryanmo.co/posts/Tech/2015-02-09/dropbox_events.py\">here</a></p>\n<p><strong>Dropbox inbox</strong></p>\n<p>Throughout the week, I'll add files to an \"Inbox\" in my Dropbox folder. On the weekends, I send myself a push notification if there have been any files added so that I can deal with them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"media\">Media</h2>\n<p>I don't have a lot of media. I've never been attached to the idea of owning my music or video and stream whatever I can. For any content that I've ripped over the years, I have <a href=\"https://plex.tv\">Plex</a> running on my Mac Mini. Again, since the connection is so fast, there's little to no lag when streaming something from home or on my phone. </p>\n<div class=\"footnote\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>I've recently switched from Omnifocus to Due2. It took me a bit to figure out how to programmatically create task items, especially if I want emojis in it. See <a href=\"http://unduressing.com/post/108269360039/how-i-use-due-2-come-with-me-if-you-want-to-live\">this</a> post for a good reason to use emojis for tasks in Due.

In an effort to eliminate the need for people to convert times themselves, I wrote a TextExpander snippet to take care of it for me.</p>\n\n\n<p>There are tons of tools out there that show you what time it is in other parts of the world. One thing that isn't as readily available is a quick way to tell me what time it would be in California if it's 3:00pm in Dublin. I decided to write a quick TextExpander snippet that would let me pick the time and then it would output the time in all of my chosen time zones. </p>\n<p>The first step is to choose the time zones that you want to appear. In my case, I chose the following since we have offices in these locations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Europe/Dublin</li>\n<li>America/Los_Angeles</li>\n<li>America/Chicago</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now I need to convert a chosen time to all of these time zones. This can be done using the <code>date</code> command in bash. Here's a quick example to try in the Terminal:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"err\">TZ=Europe/Dublin date -jf &quot;%H:%M %z&quot; &quot;$(date &quot;+%H:%M %z&quot;)&quot; &quot;+%H:%M %Z&quot;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<ul>\n<li>TZ lets you choose the time zone for the <code>date</code> command</li>\n<li>-f tells <code>date</code> the format to expect for the input</li>\n<li>-j tells <code>date</code> to not change the date allowing the -f flag to convert a time</li>\n<li>\"$(date \"+%H:%M %z\")\" just gives the current date that looks like HH:MM +0100</li>\n<li>\"+%H:%M %Z\" is the output format</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This gives you the following result:</p>\n<p>04:52 IST</p>\n<p>Now to do this for multiple time zones:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nv\">timezones</span><span class=\"o\">=(</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot;</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;America/Chicago&quot;</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;Europe/Dublin&quot;</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> zone <span class=\"k\">in</span> <span class=\"si\">${</span><span class=\"nv\">timezones</span><span class=\"p\">[@]</span><span class=\"si\">}</span>\n<span class=\"k\">do</span>\n    <span class=\"nv\">TZ</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nv\">$zone</span> date -jf <span class=\"s2\">&quot;%H:%M %z&quot;</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"k\">$(</span>date <span class=\"s2\">&quot;+%H:%M %z&quot;</span><span class=\"k\">)</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;+%H:%M %Z&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"k\">done</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Which gives:</p>\n<p>08:55 PDT<br />\n10:55 CDT<br />\n16:55 IST  </p>\n<p>Lastly, let's add in some TextExpander input methods, and we have a way to use this with whatever time we want:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"ch\">#! /bin/bash</span>\n\n/* \nEnter a <span class=\"nb\">time</span> using 24H. <span class=\"m\">1</span>:30pm is <span class=\"m\">13</span>:30\n*/\n<span class=\"nv\">ENTERTIME</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;%filltext:name=Hour:width=2%:%filltext:name=Minute:width=2%&quot;</span>\n\n<span class=\"nv\">timezones</span><span class=\"o\">=(</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot;</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;America/Chicago&quot;</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;Europe/Dublin&quot;</span> <span class=\"o\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> zone <span class=\"k\">in</span> <span class=\"si\">${</span><span class=\"nv\">timezones</span><span class=\"p\">[@]</span><span class=\"si\">}</span>\n<span class=\"k\">do</span>\n        <span class=\"nv\">TZ</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nv\">$zone</span> date -jf <span class=\"s2\">&quot;%H:%M %z&quot;</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$ENTERTIME</span><span class=\"s2\"> </span><span class=\"k\">$(</span>date <span class=\"s2\">&quot;+%z&quot;</span><span class=\"k\">)</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;+%H:%M %Z&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"k\">done</span>\n</code></pre></div>",

After a while, it began to feel more like a chore than the kind gesture of letting others know I made it safely. For the repetitive messages, I found  way of automating nearly the entire process.</p>\n\n\n<p>Now that Launch Center Pro has the <code>launchpro-messaging://</code> action with x-callback-url support, I can chain SMS messages together. This is something I've been wanting for a long time for this specific use case. When I began writing the action, I found one hiccup in which is I would need to write the message to each individual person unless I wanted to first copy it to my clipboard before running the action. I didn't have luck with the <code>launchpro-clipboard://</code> action while calling the clipboard from the same action even though it is supposed to work in theory<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>I decided to venture out and use Pythonista to generate the url scheme for me and then pass it back into Launch Center Pro's in-app messaging. The nice thing here is that I can cleanly list out all of the contacts to whom I'd like to send the message from with in the script and change the action much more quickly.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">contacts</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span>\n    <span class=\"s1\">&#39;friend1@dropbox.com&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"s1\">&#39;mom@gmail.com&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"s1\">&#39;+1-555-867-5309&#39;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>The script is written in such a way that I can put as many contacts in as I want and the url scheme will still get generated correctly with the url-escaping. </p>\n<p>Now, I have a nice list of message options in Launch Center Pro that will then send the same message to all of my contacts:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Launch Center Pro notifications\" src=\"https://ryanmo.co/2014/01/14/travel-notifications/lcp_notifications.png\" /></p>\n<p>If the \"Just Landed\" option is chosen, a new prompt will be given to type in the place where I landed.

While my workflow will be fairly similar to <a href=\"http://www.macstories.net/tutorials/my-photo-management-workflow-early-2014/\">Federico Viticci's</a> with a few exceptions, I thought I would share the way that I take, organize, view and share my photos.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"taking-photos\">Taking Photos</h2>\n<p>My iPhone is one of the main ways that I take photos. Since it's always in my pocket and takes great quality photos, it's by far the easiest way to take photos no matter where I am.  I've had a lot of fun with the iPhone 5S and the burst and slo-mo modes.</p>\n<p>I've never considered myself a photographer. For a long time, I had my mom's hand-me-down Olympus E-500. It was a great camera, but I had no idea how to use it and it was bigger than I preferred. Before moving to Ireland, I decided that I wanted to learn the basics of photography and have a camera that would grow with me as I learned more. The Olympus PEN E-P5 had just started pre-order and I decided that this would be my first \"real\" camera. I only had a few requirements, and it fortunately satisfied both of them: GPS tagging and small/lightweight. I've now had this the E-P5 for a little over 6 months and couldn't be happier. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"Olympus PEN E-P5\" src=\"https://ryanmo.co/2014/01/11/my-photo-workflow/ep5.jpg\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"importing\">Importing</h2>\n<p>I only have one main way to upload my photos - Dropbox Camera Uploads. Whether I use the Dropbox app for iOS or the desktop application, my photos end up in the same place to get processed (more on that later in <a href=\"#organization\">Organization</a>). </p>\n<p>Any photos that are taken on my iPhone are quickly uploaded via the Dropbox app. When I use my E-P5, I will first turn on the built-in Wifi to sync GPS data from my phone to the camera<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup>. Once that is all taken care of, I plug the camera into my laptop and Dropbox grabs the new photos and imports them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"organization\">Organization</h2>\n<p>I'm still pretty new to Hazel, but dealing with my photos was the reason I decided to bite the bullet and buy it. My Dropbox Camera Uploads folder was nearing 900 photos and I hadn't taken the time to organize them in over a year. </p>\n<p>Before Camera Uploads, I was suffering through iPhoto. It always bothered me that my photos were obfuscated from view. I always found myself wasting time trying to find the original or using the export option. When Camera Uploads was released, I searched for a way to cleanly export my photos into a Year-Month-Event folder structure. I discovered <a href=\"https://github.com/BMorearty/exportiphoto\">this script</a> that gave me more than what I wanted and solved my problem perfectly. For anyone who wants to use this, the command I used was</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"c1\"># -x deconflict export directories of same name</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># -d stop use date prefix in folder name</span>\n<span class=\"c1\"># -y add year directory to output</span>\npython exporti_photo.py -x -d -y\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>I've been using the Year-Month-Event structure for a few years now and have starting running into a slight annoyance. I find myself constantly flipping between months trying to remember when a certain event happened. I finally came to the conclusion that the month directory was pretty unnecessary. What I decided on was the folder structure Year-MM.YY Event Name. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"New Photo Structure\" src=\"https://ryanmo.co/2014/01/11/my-photo-workflow/photo_list.png\" /></p>\n<p>This gives me a much easier way to visualize my photos by event name rather than poking through folders by month.</p>\n<p>My Hazel workflow is fairly simple, but takes care of everything in one rule. I've set up a few exceptions for photo types that don't need to be sorted, such as screenshots or other PNG files. I also have rules set up for fun projects like my <a href=\"/2014/01/05/organizing-special-photos-with-hazel\">\"photo a day\"</a>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Hazel Rule\" src=\"https://ryanmo.co/2014/01/11/my-photo-workflow/photos_hazel.png\" /></p>\n<p>Finally once photos are sorted, I will manually go in and individually name all of the events that were created. This makes it much easier to search for events in the future. The next step in my process here is to tag photos. The one feature I do miss about iPhoto was the facial recognition. Since I haven't found a way to do facial recognition outside of Aperture or iPhoto, I will manually go in and tag photos with the names of those in the photos. This has been very useful when I want to find photos of people in certain contexts. For example,  the tags <code>me</code>, <code>office</code>, <code>dublin</code> will give me photos of myself in the Dublin office, but not San Francisco.</p>\n<h2 id=\"consumption-and-sharing\">Consumption and Sharing</h2>\n<p>In Mac OS X, I have three ways that I view my photos. The first, and most basic is Finder.  The Cover Flow view in Finder is actually a great way to quickly go through photos and get the ones that you want. When I'm wanting to share my photos with others, I use the <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/photos\">Dropbox Photos</a> page. As a quick way to share a select number of photos quickly, I've still found this to be the best way. For general viewing and pruning of photos I don't want, I've been using a not so well known app called <a href=\"http://www.lynapp.com\">Lyn</a>. It has some nice features for sharing to multiple services, but what I really like about it is that it'll just watch a folder and display the photos in that folder. Lyn will also let me see all of the metadata about the photos, including a map if there is GPS information. Lastly, on the rare occasion that I want to edit my photo, I will import the photo into Aperture. For the same reasons I dislike iPhoto, I dislike Aperture. I will typically import the photo, edit it, and then export back into Dropbox.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Lyn.app\" src=\"https://ryanmo.co/2014/01/11/my-photo-workflow/lyn.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>On iOS, I have two primary apps that I use to view my photos. The first, unsurprisingly, is the Dropbox app. For quick viewing and sharing, I will use Dropbox since that's where all of my photos live. As a Photos app replacement, I use <a href=\"http://unboundapp.com\">Unbound</a>. What's great about Unbound is that it treats folders in your Dropbox account like albums. Since my photos are organized this way anyways, I get perfectly created albums that I can view and even cache to my phone for offline viewing.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Dropbox and Unbound\" src=\"https://ryanmo.co/2014/01/11/my-photo-workflow/unbound_dropbox.jpg\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-future\">The Future</h2>\n<p>Dropbox has been doing a great job improving the photo experience. Photo organization is a very personal thing and trying to solve this for the majority is not an easy task. Many companies are trying to do this, and so far there has been no clear winner. As much as I love my folder organization, I would really like to get to a point where I don't even have to worry about where my photos are. The metadata of the photos should be enough for an application or website to organize the photos for me.</p>\n<p>I mentioned this earlier, but one other thing I would really like to see is a 3rd-party app that does facial recognition and applies tags or some other bit of metadata to the file. Tagging my photos with peoples' names is by far the most manual part of my photos workflow, but also one of the most important to me.</p>\n<div class=\"footnote\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>The GPS data is stored on the SD card, but I haven't taken the time to see if I can add this metadata after importing from Dropbox&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:1\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

Hazel easily takes care of of this for me, but occasionally I will have projects where photos need to be excluded or organized in a different way. With Hazel, I can still account for these special cases with extra bits of metadata.</p>\n\n\n<p>This may not come in handy to anyone, but I thought it would be worth showing some of the creative ways that Hazel can be used to organize your files based on more than just creation/modification time or file type.</p>\n<p>In late May 2013, I decided I wanted to do one of those time lapse videos where you take a picture of yourself in front of the camera every day. At first, the hardest part was just remembering to take the picture each day. Once I was in the routine, I started to find the task monotonous to pull the photo from my Dropbox folder, rename it to YYYY-MM-DD.jpg and then move it into a special folder I had creatively named \"Picture a Day.\" Hazel was already taking care of my general photo organization, but I wanted to ensure that these photos got organized specifically so I started digging into the special traits of these photos. I quickly found a few default options in Hazel that would help me do this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Device make</li>\n<li>Pixel width/height</li>\n<li>Content creator</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I was always using Camera+ for these photos because of the grid and level features. It allowed me to align my face in the same place in the photos. Since I always used the front camera, the dimensions of the photos remained the same. After playing around, here is the Hazel rule I came up with</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Hazel Picture a Day\" src=\"https://ryanmo.co/2014/01/05/organizing-special-photos-with-hazel/hazel_picture_a_day.png\" /></p>\n<p>Another key piece here is the datestamp token. The rule watches for Dropbox's Camera Uploads filename format YYYY-MM-DD HH.MM.SS.jpg. This wouldn't be necessary except for that this token then becomes useful in the actions portion. I can take that token and rename the file based on the token to simply YYYY-MM-DD.jpg since I don't care about the hour the photo was taken. What's great about the token is that this will prevent accidental naming of the file if I happen to upload it the next day or I'm flying between Ireland and the US and date times get messed up.</p>\n<p>While this rule is fairly specific, it's saved me a lot of time having to organize the photos manually. </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>It's been a few months now since I switched from <a href=\"http://mynt.mirroredwhite.com\">Mynt</a> to <a href=\"http://blog.getpelican.com\">Pelican</a> as my static blog generator and so far I've been very happy with the switch. It's been a learning process along the way, but I've come to the point where I'm comfortable enough with it and want to start customizing and automating.</p>\n<h2 id=\"customization\">Customization</h2>\n<p>I haven't done much yet in terms of customization quite yet, but I'm adding little bits every day.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"original-files\">Original Files</h3>\n<p>I recently updated Pelican to the newest version 3.3. The part that was new to me here was that you have the option to keep the original file in your output directory.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"c1\"># Set to True if you want to copy the articles and pages in their original format (e.g. Markdown or reStructuredText) to the specified OUTPUT_PATH.</span>\n<span class=\"n\">OUTPUT_SOURCES</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kc\">True</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p><strong>Update 2014-02-25:</strong> Turns out this was a bug. It's been since fixed. See the thread <a href=\"https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/pull/1183\">here</a> on github. </p>\n<p>I'm not entirely sure if it's a bug or something I was doing wrong, but I noticed that instead of creating an index.txt for every index.md file, it would create a directory called index.txt and then place the original markdown file within it. I did some poking around in the source code and found a slight issue with the <code>copy</code> function within the util.py file. It was checking if any destination existed, and if not, it would create a new directory.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"ow\">not</span> <span class=\"n\">os</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">path</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">exists</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">destination_</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">os</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">makedirs</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">destination_</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>I made a couple of changes to prevent this from happening. The first was that I added an additional argument to the function called <code>is_file</code> and then added this to the destination check</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">copy</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">path</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">source</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">destination</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">destination_path</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"kc\">None</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">is_file</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"kc\">False</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>\n<span class=\"o\">...</span>\n<span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"ow\">not</span> <span class=\"n\">os</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">path</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">exists</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">destination_</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"ow\">and</span> <span class=\"ow\">not</span> <span class=\"n\">is_file</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">os</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">makedirs</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">destination_</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Finally, in generators.py, I added the argument where the copy function is called in <code>_create_source</code> in the <code>SourceFileGenerator</code> class.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">copy</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">obj</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">source_path</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">dest</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">is_file</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"kc\">True</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Now that the files are being generated correctly, I used the tip by Gabe Weatherhead over at <a href=\"http://www.macdrifter.com/tag/pelican.html\">Macdrifter</a> to add a link to the original file for every post. You can see an example of this post at the bottom of the page.</p>\n<h3 id=\"automatic-posting-to-appnet\">Automatic Posting to App.net</h3>\n<p>App.net's new Broadcast platform is pretty cool. I've subscribed to a few people already and I like the idea of having a way to broadcast each post that's made. Pelican doesn't have a great way to detect new posts, so I'm playing with my own solution by keeping track of every post and comparing.</p>\n<p>In my Fabric file, I created a function to check for new posts and then use the App.net Broadcast API to make a post</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">adn</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">current_posts</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">util</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">current_posts</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">post_history</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">pickler</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">load_old_results</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;lib/posts.pkl&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">new_posts</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nb\">list</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">current_posts</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">-</span> <span class=\"nb\">set</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">post_history</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">new_posts</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">post</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">new_posts</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">get_adn</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">util</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">ADN</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">POST_PATH</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">post</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">get_adn</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">post</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">pickler</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">store_results</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;lib/posts.pkl&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">current_posts</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>I get the current posts by simply listing the contents of the posts directory and then compare to what was previously stored the last time a new post was made. I keep this is a file called lib/util.py, which explains why I have to call <code>os.path.dirname</code> twice.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">current_posts</span><span class=\"p\">():</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">post_path</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">os</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">path</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">join</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">os</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">path</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">dirname</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">os</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">path</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">dirname</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">os</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">path</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">abspath</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"vm\">__file__</span><span class=\"p\">))),</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;content&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">&#39;posts&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">f</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">f</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">os</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">listdir</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">post_path</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"ow\">not</span> <span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">startswith</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;.&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">)]</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>This seems to be the most reliable solution since it won't send broadcasts if I edit a file. Finally, when the publish function is called from my fabfile, I call <code>adn()</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"automation\">Automation</h2>\n<p>I'm traveling a lot these days, which means that sometimes I only have my iPad or iPhone with me. I'd still like to easily create posts without having to write up the post, log in via Prompt, commit and push. I went with a setup fairly similar to <a href=\"http://www.evanlovely.com/notes/about-this-jekyll-site/\">Evan Lovely</a> and use Hazel to watch for new posts within a directory. </p>\n<p>My Hazel workflow relies on an additional piece of metadata in my posts instead of just the file itself.

Even Siri can do this fairly well, but the one thing I always find frustrating is that the process of doing this can be fairly slow and in a lot of cases requires a data connection. Growing up in the United States, I was unfortunately never exposed to the metric system or Celsius. Since I've moved to Dublin, I'm find myself doing a lot of conversions from one unit to another.</p>\n\n\n<p>I was poking around in <a href=\"http://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/\">Launch Center Pro</a> for iOS the other day to just see what kinds of things I could do, and I noticed one of the options was <a href=\"http://www.acqualia.com/soulver/iphone/\">Soulver</a>. My main use case for Soulver has always been one-off conversions or keeping score while playing Farkle with my girlfriend. It occurred to me that this would make a really nice way to do quick conversions. </p>\n<p>I didn't want to have to create a mess of different actions for each unit. The way around this was to create a variable within Soulver and always reference back to it with multiple conversions. I started out simple with a quick US Dollar to Euro and Pounds and vice-versa. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"Currency Conversion\" src=\"https://ryanmo.co/2013/12/03/quick-conversions-with-launch-center-pro-and-soulver/lcp_currency.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>To achieve this, Launch Center Pro uses x-callback-urls which allows apps to send data to another app and perform actions. The following url requests a number and then sends over this number as a variable to Soulver</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>soulver://new?text=x%20%3D%20[prompt-num:Text]%0Ax%20euro%20to%20usd%0Ax%20gbp%20to%20usd%0A----------------%0Ax%20usd%20to%20euro%0Ax%20usd%20to%20gbp%0A----------------<span class=\"err\">&amp;</span>title=Currency%20Conversion\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>This worked perfectly and solved the two biggest requirements that I had: to be quick and to not rely on a data connection.

Dropbox is a great way to post an image quickly on a forum or as free hosting for your low traffic website, but there are a few things to know.</p>\n\n\n<p>In the early days, Dropbox offered a Public folder where you could easily serve webpages, images or anything else you want to share to the world. The risk there is that the links to the files were formulaic and anyone could crawl your Public folder looking for things they maybe shouldn't have. This formula looked like this:</p>\n<p>www.dropbox.com/u/&lt;number>/&lt;name of file></p>\n<p>To add a level of security to the shared links, Dropbox now has a hashed value so that someone would then need to know the unique hash as well as the file name. The chances that someone is able to guess both of these within the next 10,000 years is pretty low. The second thing that was added was a preview to your shared links. If you have images, you see a nice gallery in your links and Office documents now have a preview. The downside here is that simple file hosting doesn't work by pasting in the link.</p>\n<p>To solve this, you just need to change the actual shared link with the link to the file itself. To do this, you just need to replace <code>www.dropbox.com</code> with <code>dl.dropboxusercontent.com</code>. This will serve the true file instead of the file wrapped in a preview. For those of you using snippet software like TextExpander, you can make this a lot faster by making a shell script snippet with the following:</p>\n<table class=\"codehilitetable\"><tr><td class=\"linenos\"><div class=\"linenodiv\"><pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5</pre></div></td><td class=\"code\"><div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"ch\">#!/bin/bash</span>\n\n<span class=\"nv\">url</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"k\">$(</span><span class=\"nb\">echo</span> %clipboard <span class=\"p\">|</span> sed <span class=\"s1\">&#39;s/www.dropbox.com/dl.dropboxusercontent.com/g&#39;</span> <span class=\"p\">|</span> tr -d <span class=\"s1\">&#39;\\n&#39;</span><span class=\"k\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"nb\">echo</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$url</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Now an image like</p>\n<p>https://www.dropbox.com/s/kyjm1pr79g2irfj/Guinness%20Storehouse%20top.jpg</p>\n<p>turns into this:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/kyjm1pr79g2irfj/Guinness%20Storehouse%20top.jpg\" src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/kyjm1pr79g2irfj/Guinness%20Storehouse%20top.jpg\" /></p>",

Instead of having to manually pull the pics down, write up a post and publish it, I used a combination of IFTTT, Dropbox and my server at Macminicolo.net to do all the work for me.</p>\n<p>The magic starts at IFTTT. I have a <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/recipes/115652\">recipe</a> that watched for a particular tag when I post to Instagram. If that tag exists, a text file is saved to my Dropbox account. I have a cron running once an hour<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup> to run the script and check for any new files.</p>\n<p>One of the only complaints about Scriptogr.am has been that I have to manually hit a publish button before posts will go live. But with their API, the posts are immediate<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a class=\"footnote-ref\" href=\"#fn:2\">2</a></sup>. Now, all of my Instagram adventures (and my girlfriend's) can be posted to our blog for friends and family to follow.

It let me keep the simplicity of plain text but format the note with the wonders of Markdown. </p>\n\n\n<p>Now I was left with another problem. I was annoyed having to command-tab over to NVAlt, command-D to go to the search field and type just to find the note. With Alfred 2's new File Filter, I can now search specifically for my notes within Alfred. I now just launch Alfred, type 'note' and any keywords I want and am immediately taken to my note in NVAlt. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"alfred_note\" src=\"https://ryanmo.co/2013/05/14/notes_and_alfred/alfred_note.png\" /></p>\n<p>This last week I've spent a lot of time writing up plans and documents. I wouldn't put NVAlt in the category of great text editors and so I've been using MultiMarkdown Composer, but I'm still saving to the same notes folder. It seemed only obvious to add more functionality to my Alfred script. Now I can optionally hold down command or control to open my note in MultiMarkdown Composer or Byword respectively. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"open_in_mmc\" src=\"https://ryanmo.co/2013/05/14/notes_and_alfred/open_in_mmc.png\" /></p>\n<p>You can download the Alfred Extension here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ryanmo.co/2013/05/14/notes_and_alfred/Notes.alfredworkflow\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://ryanmo.co/images/alfred_extension.jpg\" /></a>  </p>\n<p>Be sure to set your path to your notes folder in the File Filter under Search Scope. If you're using Notational Velocity, you can change which application is opened in the action script. </p>",

Every time I'd learn something new, I would keep it in a text file with TextEdit. This was good and fine until a coworker introduced me to Notational Velocity. This completely changed the way I managed my notes but I always felt like I was missing something. That's when I discovered NVAlt. It let me keep the simplicity of plain text but format the note with the wonders of Markdown. </p>\n",

I keep mine in a folder called Sync that's shared between my work and personal Dropbox accounts.

From now on, just point the local .bash_profile to the one location in your Dropbox folder.</p>",
