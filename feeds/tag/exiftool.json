From what I have seen so far, the best exif tag to go on is <code>-filemodifydate</code>, but you'll probably need to figure that out on your own. If you want to fix any photo that matches the above criteria, you can do something like this</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>exiftool <span class=\"sb\">`</span>-datetimeoriginal&lt;filemodifydate<span class=\"sb\">`</span> -r -if <span class=\"s1\">&#39;(not $datetimeoriginal or ($datetimeoriginal eq &quot;0000:00:00 00:00:00&quot;)) and ($filetype eq &quot;JPEG&quot;)&#39;</span> ~/Dropbox\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<div class=\"footnote\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>2965 photos to be exact.&#160;<a class=\"footnote-backref\" href=\"#fnref:1\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text\">&#8617;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
