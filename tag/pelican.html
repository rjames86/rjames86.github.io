        <p>Brent Simmons and Manton Reece recently <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/2017/05/17/announcing_json_feed">announced</a> an alternative to RSS and Atom using JSON. The format is straight forward and seemed like a great fit to implement in Pelican.</p>

        <p>As it turns out, adding <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/understanding-critical-css/">critical css</a> wasn't trivial, but didn't take as much effort as I had originally thought. My site's layout doesn't contain <em>that</em> much styling, and so I simply added all of my CSS as an inline <code>style</code> tag. The tricky part, was getting Jinja to play …</p>

        <p>I really enjoy writing in MultiMarkdown Composer and having Marked display a rendered version. When writing blog posts like this, images would never appear since Pelican's syntax for displaying images is <code>{static}/path/to/image</code>.
