Living in the U.S. we rarely call people outside of the country. Whenever we create new contacts in our address book, they'll typically start with the state's area code and omit the country code. 
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->  

Since moving to Ireland, my contacts wouldn't show up correctly since I hadn't prepended all of contacts with '+1'. I wasn't about to manually change all 700 contacts in my phone and fortunately came across a [nice post][post] that had the following AppleScript:
    
{! /assets/articles/i18n-contacts/addressBook.scpt !} 

Before running this, I highly recommend backing up your contacts. This can be run easily by just launching AppleScript Editor and pasting in the code above. Enjoy!
