On a rare occasion, I need to view files in my Dropbox folder on my computer on the website. The most common use case is I want to see the entire structure of a directory. I [selectively unsync][selectivesync] a lot of large directories since my MacBook Air has limited hard drive space. I want to quickly go to the Dropbox website and view this particular folder without having to re-navigate to it's location.
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->  

To use, navigate to any file/folder from within Alfred and trigger the Actions panel. I have a file filter set up to search specifically my Dropbox folder

and trigger Actions to browse on Dropbox
