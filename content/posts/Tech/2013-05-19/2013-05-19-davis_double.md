I've never done an actual bike ride before. A friend and I decided that we would try our luck at a double century[^1]. We ended up finishing in around 16 hours. The ride went really well up until the 185 mile mark where my tire decided to explode.

They first told me that I was just going to have to be driven to the finish line. Luckily someone decided to get creative and boot the tire. We placed a piece of cut tire unbetween the tube and the tire. Once the tire part was fixed, we wrapped the tire in duct tape to keep it from possibly blowing again.

All in all it was a great day.
