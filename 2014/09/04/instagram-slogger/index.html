    <p>In early 2013, I discovered Slogger and loved the idea of journalling about more than just what I had to say. What I was listening to at a given time is just as important as what I was thinking. However, there wasn't an ideal way to log Instagram posts without other dependencies, and so I took a stab at writing my first plugin.</p>


<hr />
<p><em>Update</em></p>
<p>As of June 2016, Instagram has changed their API and no longer allows this script to work. Sorry :(</p>
<hr />
<p>I didn't know ruby and quickly learned how bad some API documentation can be, but I wanted this plugin more than all the others. After fiddling with it for an evening, I was able to log Instagram posts with more than just a photo, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>number of likes</li>
<li>comments</li>
<li>date of post, not the date Slogger ran</li>
<li>location data (including place name if you used Foursquare checkin)</li>
</ul>
<p>The last point is by far my favorite. I can look at a map over the last year and see all the Instagram photos I've taken and where I took them</p>
<p><img alt="Instagram map" src="https://ryanmo.co/2014/09/04/instagram-slogger/dayonemap.png" /></p>
<p>I also wanted to import photos that I had already taken. The plugin now will let you set <code>backdate: true</code> and will log the last 20 photos that you had posted on Instagram. Once it's finished, it'll automatically set itself to false to prevent duplicate posts<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Setup is fairly straight forward. I create a local server, which runs you through the Instagram OAuth flow. After you've finished, you simply paste in the access token, and it'll run from there</p>

<p>Last night I finally did a pull request and it went live this morning. You can check out and download the latest Slogger on <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/Slogger">Github</a>. If you find any issues or bugs, please send them my way. Enjoy!</p>
